      <h2>1. Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        A primary goal of ACM BVP is to be inclusive to the largest number of
        contributors, with technical or educational background. As such, we are
        committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
        all, regardless of gender, ability, ethnicity, and religion (or lack
        thereof). This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those
        who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for
        unacceptable behavior. We invite all those who participate in ACM BVP
        activities to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship</h2>
      <p>
        A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open
        [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to
        recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their
        effects on our community. Communities mirror the societies in which they
        exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of
        inequality and abuses of power that exist in society. If you see someone
        who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming,
        friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest
        extent, we want to know.
      </p>

      <p>
        No weapons will be allowed at ACM BVP’s events, community spaces, or in
        other spaces covered by the scope of this Code of Conduct. Weapons
        include but are not limited to guns, explosives (including fireworks),
        and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as
        any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others.
        Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave
        immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon.
        Community members are further expected to comply with all state and
        local laws on this matter.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior</h2>
      <p>
        Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and
        those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Anyone
        asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.
        If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community
        organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and
        including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community
        without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

      <h2>7. Reporting Guidelines</h2>
      <p>
        If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any
        other concerns, please notify any of the community organizers as soon as
        possible. Additionally, community organizers are available to help
        community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help
        those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of
        in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the
        person experiencing distress.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Addressing Grievances</h2>
      <p>
        If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this
        Code of Conduct, you should notify Bharati Vidyapeeth’s College of
        Engineering (coedelhi@bharatividyapeeth.edu) with a concise description

        community venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one
